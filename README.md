## Overview

**AWS IoT** provides the cloud services that connect your IoT devices to other devices and AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides device software that can help you integrate your IoT devices into AWS IoT-based solutions. If your devices can connect to AWS IoT, AWS IoT can connect them to the cloud services that AWS provides.
AWS IoT can provide support for your compatible devices to facilitate the development and integration of your devices with AWS IoT. To help you manage and support your IoT devices in the field, AWS IoT communication supports **MQTT** (Message Queuing and Telemetry Transport) and **HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol - Secure).

## Concept

<p><br>
<div align="center">  
  
I have used a `publish`and `subscribe` method for current demonstration.**ESP8266-12E** module incuded as a microcontroller for the communication with **AWS IoT Core**.

</div>

Here we have some points to note:

> - You must need an **AWS IoT Core** console/account for the demonstation.Details on below section (**Steps**). 
> - This concept works on ESP8266 Arduino Core v2.4.2 and v2.4.0.
> - Communications are secured by TLS version 1.2. Arduino IDE & ESP8266 Suports TLS V1.2.
> - **AWS IoT Core** supports `MQTT` and `MQTT over WSS` protocols. We are using ***MQTT over WSS*** method with ***sigv4*** authentication and port **443**.


## Software
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for Windows, Linux or Mac OS.

## Steps :
 1. **Download** the repo.
 
 2. For those who don't have an ***AWS IoT core*** ðŸ˜‡ download the ***AWS IOT CORE WITH ESP8266*** named pdf from the **DOC** folder and carefully read it. 
     Create a dashboard with at least one ***thing***. Create your **AWS** account [here](https://aws.amazon.com/).
   
 3. Open **LIB** folder from the downloaded repo then extract the `ZIP` file and place the four folders into your Arduino local directory folder
    (libraries). Folders(libraries) with name given below :
    
    - aws-mqtt-websockets-master
    - AWS-SDK-ESP8266
    - PubSubClient
    - WebSockets
    
    You have an alternate option to download the library from the Arduino library manager. But I am not suggesting that way in this case ðŸ‘Ž. 
    
 4. The **source code** for our ESP8266 simulation can be found in the **CODE** folder. Open **source code** from the downloaded repo and make some changes as mentioned below :
   
   - Open **global.h** and provide your wifi router's `ssid` and `password` :

</p  
  
<p><br> 
  
   - Open **aws.cpp** and fill your credentials here ðŸ‘‡ . For more info refer the document page ***number 9***.

## Compatibility
This library was tested with the NodeMCU V1.0 & ESP8266-12E board. It should also work with other standard ESP8266 that are compatible with the Arduino IDE.
ESP8266 core version that I have tested is `2.4.2`. 

## Working & Testing
